## Design System

### Color Palette

**Semantic Colors:**

- Breakpoint: 768px

## Technical Details

**Output Format:**
- Standalone HTML5 files
- All CSS embedded in `<style>` tags
- All SVG inline (no external images)
- Responsive viewBox-based SVG scaling
- Cross-browser compatible (modern browsers)

**File Size:**
- Typical output: 50-150 KB
- No external dependencies
- Fast loading and rendering

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG AA compliant color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Text labels for all visual elements
- Keyboard navigation support

## Customization

The skill automatically adapts to your content while maintaining:
- Consistent design language
- Professional visual hierarchy
- Responsive layout
- Accessibility standards

Customize by providing:
- Specific data and metrics
- Process steps and relationships
- Color preferences (will map to semantic system)
- Content sections and organization

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific about content** - Provide actual data, process steps, or structure
2. **Request iterative refinement** - Ask for changes to colors, layout, or styling
3. **Combine visualization types** - Mix flowcharts with metrics, timelines with dashboards
4. **Save outputs** - Specify file path to save the generated HTML
5. **Test responsiveness** - View on different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** SVG not displaying correctly
- Check that the HTML is opened in a modern browser
- Ensure file is saved with `.html` extension

**Issue:** Layout broken on mobile
- The design is responsive by default
- Verify viewport meta tag is present

**Issue:** Colors look different than expected
- All colors use consistent hex values
- Check browser color profile settings
