# Git Push Workflow

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

### Fast Path (Recommended)

Use the automated script for maximum speed:

```bash
bash scripts/smart_commit.sh
```

This script handles:
- âœ… Staging all changes
- âœ… Auto-generating conventional commit messages
- âœ… Adding Claude Code footer
- âœ… Pushing to remote (with -u for new branches)
- âœ… Showing PR link for GitHub repos

**With custom message:**
```bash
bash scripts/smart_commit.sh "feat: add new feature"
```

The script automatically:
- Determines commit type (feat/fix/docs/test/chore/refactor)
- Extracts scope from changed files
- Handles new vs existing branches
- Shows colored output for better UX

### Manual Path (Fallback)

Use when script is unavailable or custom workflow needed:

**1. Check Git Status**

Run `git status` to understand:
- Which files have changed
- What will be committed
- Current branch name

**2. Stage Changes**

- Run `git add .` to stage all changes
- Alternatively, stage specific files if partial commit is needed

**3. Create Commit Message**

**If user provided a message:**
- Use it directly

**If no message provided:**
- Analyze changes using `git diff`
- Generate a conventional commit message:
  - Format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
  - Keep description concise (50-90 characters)
  - Use imperative mood: "Add" not "Added"
- Always append Claude Code footer:
  ```

  ```

**Use heredoc format:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
commit message here

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

)"
```

**4. Push to Remote**

- Run `git push` to push commits
- If new branch, use `git push -u origin <branch>`
- If push fails due to diverged branches, inform user and ask how to proceed

**5. Confirm Success**

- Report commit hash
- Summarize what was committed
- Confirm push succeeded

## Examples

User: "Push these changes"
â†’ Check status, stage all, generate commit message, push

User: "Commit with message 'fix: resolve table extraction issue'"
â†’ Use provided message, push

User: "Let's save this to github"
â†’ Activate workflow, generate appropriate commit message
