# Git Push Workflow

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

### 1. Check Git Status

Run `git status` to understand:
- Which files have changed
- What will be committed
- Current branch name

### 2. Stage Changes

- Run `git add .` to stage all changes
- Alternatively, stage specific files if partial commit is needed

### 3. Create Commit Message

**If user provided a message:**
- Use it directly

**If no message provided:**
- Analyze changes using `git diff`
- Generate a conventional commit message:
  - Format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
  - Keep description concise (50-90 characters)
  - Use imperative mood: "Add" not "Added"
- Always append Claude Code footer:
  ```

  ```

**Use heredoc format:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
commit message here

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

EOF
)"
```

### 4. Push to Remote

- Run `git push` to push commits
- If push fails due to diverged branches, inform user and ask how to proceed

### 5. Confirm Success

- Report commit hash
- Summarize what was committed
- Confirm push succeeded

## Examples

User: "Push these changes"
â†’ Check status, stage all, generate commit message, push

User: "Commit with message 'fix: resolve table extraction issue'"
â†’ Use provided message, push

User: "Let's save this to github"
â†’ Activate workflow, generate appropriate commit message
